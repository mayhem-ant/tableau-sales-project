## Conclusion

2023 demonstrated strong overall growth with 20.36% increase in sales and 8.6% customer base expansion. However, profitability growth (14.24%) lags behind revenue growth, indicating margin compression that requires attention. The concentration of revenue among top customers presents both an opportunity (deepen relationships) and a risk (over-reliance). Strategic focus on product mix optimization and customer lifetime value enhancement will be critical for sustainable growth in 2024.
